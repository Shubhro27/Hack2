    <u>What you'll like:</u>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • A well-built European SUV with classy styling
    <br/>
    • Spacious, high-quality cabin. Big 615-liter boot too
    <br/>
    • Smooth 7-speed DSG automatic. Lightning quick upshifts
    <br/>
    • Impressive highway stability &amp; handling for a Crossover
    <br/>
    • AWD is standard. Good for touring &amp; tackling rough terrain
    <br/>
• Loaded with features &amp; technology (    <em>including a beautiful panoramic sunroof</em>)
    <br/>
    • 5-star NCAP rating &amp; top-notch safety kit
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <u>What you won't:</u>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    • Overpriced by a couple of lakhs! Heavy premium over the Hyundai Tucson
    <br/>
    • Many will find the design too bland &amp; understated. Lacks street cred
    <br/>
    • Engine feels <em>adequate</em>, but isn't exciting. You'd expect more
    power at this price
    <br/>
• Stiff ride quality, especially on the back seat (    <em>our test car had the 18" rims</em>)
    <br/>
    • Despite this being a new wet clutch DSG, we have our finger's crossed on
    its reliability
    <br/>
    • No cheaper MT or FWD variants
    <br/>
    • VW's sub-par dealership &amp; service experiences
    <br/>
